# Python training notes by Pavel Šimerda

  * [Python I](https://github.com/devel-training/python/tree/master/i)
  * [Python II](https://github.com/devel-training/python/tree/master/ii)

Notes:

  - I work on linux distributions where python works natively without
    any specific installation or configuration procedure. Windows and Mac
    users should have their python installations ready for the training.
  - We will be using python 3.5/3.6 for the training.
  - Using an IDE is not part of the training. A basic text editor suitable
    for programming and a terminal window are all that you need.
  - Altering the course to fit your needs is possible and encouraged.
